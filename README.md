Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are everywhere. It is arguably the most popular deep learning architecture. The recent surge of interest in deep learning is due to the immense popularity and effectiveness of convnets. 

The interest in CNN started with AlexNet in 2012 and it has grown exponentially ever since. In just three years, researchers progressed from 8 layer AlexNet to 152 layer ResNet.

CNN is now the go-to model on every image related problem. In terms of accuracy they blow competition out of the water. It is also successfully applied to recommender systems, natural language processing and more. 

The main advantage of CNN compared to its predecessors is that it automatically detects the important features without any human supervision. For example, given many pictures of cats and dogs it learns distinctive features for each class by itself.

CNN is also computationally efficient. It uses special convolution and pooling operations and performs parameter sharing. This enables CNN models to run on any device, making them universally attractive.

All in all this sounds like pure magic. We are dealing with a very powerful and efficient model which performs automatic feature extraction to achieve superhuman accuracy (yes CNN models now do image classification better than humans).
